# aSTEAM Project
App-Specialized Transport for Evolvability, Autonomicity, and Measurability
## Introduction to aSTEAM Project
aSTEAM Project (pronounced like “Ace Team”) develops a transport networking technology for app-specialized Web experience. aSTEAM Project consists of three projects designed for evolvability, measurability, and autonomicity, respectively. The first project implements a continuously evolvable autonomous transmission networking control framework that be easily deployed to the current networks. In the second project, a device profiling system collects application characteristics, quantified user experience, and device profiles from endpoints. Along with the two expected deliverables, the third project investigates analytics techniques to improve Web experience through the autonomous development of transport protocols based on data-driven networking analytics. Ultimately, the projects are converged onto the evolvable, measurable and autonomous transport networking technology that autonomously identifies problems for better Web experience through networking analytics.

> aSTEAM Project is supported by Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT.
